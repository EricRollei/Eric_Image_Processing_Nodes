# Eric's Image Processing Nodes - Requirements
# Install with: pip install -r requirements.txt

# Core dependencies
numpy>=1.21.0
opencv-python>=4.5.0
scikit-image>=0.19.0
scipy>=1.7.0
PyWavelets>=1.3.0

# Optional dependencies for enhanced functionality
matplotlib>=3.3.0  # For visualization in test scripts
torch>=1.9.0  # Already available in ComfyUI
torchvision>=0.10.0  # For additional image processing utilities
facexlib>=0.3.0  # Required for DiffBIR face restoration helpers

# GPU acceleration (optional but recommended)
# Install ONE of these based on your CUDA version:
# cupy-cuda11x  # For CUDA 11.x
# cupy-cuda12x  # For CUDA 12.x (recommended for latest systems)

# Performance optimization (optional)
# numba>=0.56.0  # For JIT compilation speedups

# Development dependencies (optional)
# pytest>=6.0.0  # For running tests
# black>=21.0.0  # For code formatting
# flake8>=3.9.0  # For linting

# Note: For GPU acceleration, install CuPy manually:
# pip install cupy-cuda12x  # or cupy-cuda11x for older CUDA versions
# GPU acceleration provides 2-5x speedup for wavelet denoising on large images
